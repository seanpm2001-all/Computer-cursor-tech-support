# Prototype info

This was the original draft document for personal reference that inspired this public project. Please note that I don't have very good handwriting. I plan on getting a document/photo scanner for future works someday, so that I don't have to capture over a table.

By the way, if you can easily make out my handwriting here or in other places, you are one of the few who actually can read my handwriting properly. I go a bit fast (but not close to as fast as when I am typing, where I have a 5+x speed boost) and also try to make my works a bit cryptic (I didn't make this one cryptic, if it is, it wasn't on purpose) so that they don't get scanned as easily during the file transfer process.
