# Windows 10 update joke

I made a joke in the article that I regret but also stand by about Windows 10, joking about the forced updates in Windows 10 and telling the reader to ignore the "update and" portion "if they didn't have their daily forced Windows update yet" I have been criticized for this by 1 family member. I will try to be more neutral in the future, especially when I am trying to support Windows, although the forced updates in Windows 10 are a real problem, and are one of the major reasons why many people switch to Linux (it is justifiable too, as Windows will update, no matter how much unsaved work you have open, and then it will change several settings without your permission, so you have to change them back after every update) this is one of the major reasons why I switched to Linux, and is the easiest one to jusitfy to anyone.

This joke may be removed in future releases, but it is up for debate. It will still be kept in version 1, and version 1 translations, I can't modify that. Same goes with the document you are reading right now, it won't be removed.
